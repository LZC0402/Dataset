#Dataset Description

#1.Selection of 36 groups MRI with visible lesions.

#2.The first 34 groups are used for training, and the final 2 are used for testing.

#3.Annotated datasets are sliced along the vertical axis, converting the original MRI scans and their corresponding lesion annotations into layer-by-layer images.

#4.The converted MRI slices serve as input, and the lesion annotations serve as output to train the network. This process establishes our prostate segmentation method.

#5.Original PICAI dataset available at: https://pi-cai.grand-challenge.org/
